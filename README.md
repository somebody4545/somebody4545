 ## Hi!
 

 - This github contains most of my coding projects (obviously)
 - I mainly code in Python, but also have a good amount of experience with Java, C#, and web design
 - I also compete in robotics (FTC 21370)
 - The best ways to contact me are through Discord [here](https://discord.com/users/697913907528073296) and by email [here](mailto:somebody.4545@outlook.com)
